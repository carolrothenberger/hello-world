Hi hi hi

I am Carol Rothenberger,
An up-and-coming fashionista, creative, politico, code-typing woman. Maybe your first Female president.
I thrive on awkward humor and too much caffeine.
Details are my world- as are my dog, family, and friends. 
I have been to hell and back, and I'm here to go even farther.
